They are not dangerous in themselves but can lead to other health problems if left untreated. In this article we will discuss what causes them, their symptoms and how to get rid of them for good! Many people have just one or two panic attacks in their lifetimes, and the problem goes away, perhaps when a stressful situation ends. But if youâ€™ve had recurrent, unexpected panic attacks and spent long periods in constant fear of another attack, you may have a condition called panic disorder.

Treatment can be very effective especially if applied early on.", creation_date: new Date(2022, 0, 1).toISOString().split("T")[0]},
